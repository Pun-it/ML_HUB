<h2>What I wanted to do ? </h2>

<b>To train an autoencoder that can tell between real and AI generated images.</b>

<b>How ?</b>

It is only trained on real human faces so that when you predict with AI generated images you will get a lot of reconstrution loss.

[I'm not sure if it would work or not but you can give it a try ðŸ˜¸]
